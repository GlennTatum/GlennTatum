I am a first year Computer Science student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I am interested in Site Reliability Engineering and Distributed Systems. 

Currently at RIT I am a workshop lead in the Google Development Club, where I host talks on Cloud Native technologies and teach students about DevOps and programming in Go.
